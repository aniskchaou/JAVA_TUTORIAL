//Socket Programming

//Sockets provide the communication mechanism between two computers using TCP. 
//A client program creates a socket on its end of the communication and attempts to connect that socket to a server.

//When the connection is made, the server creates a socket object on its end of the communication.
//The client and the server can now communicate by writing to and reading from the socket.

//The java.net.Socket class represents a socket, and the java.net.ServerSocket class 
//provides a mechanism for the server program to listen for clients and establish connections with them.

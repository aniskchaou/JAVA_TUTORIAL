//Java provides a mechanism, called object serialization where an object can be represented as a sequence 
//of bytes that includes the object's data as well as information about the object's type and the types of 
//data stored in the object.

//After a serialized object has been written into a file, it can be read from the file and deserialized that is, 
//the type information and bytes that represent the object and its data can be used to recreate the object in memory.

//Most impressive is that the entire process is JVM independent, meaning an object can be serialized on 
//one platform and deserialized on an entirely different platform.
